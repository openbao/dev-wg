# Development Working Group

The Development Working Group, or Dev WG for short, focuses on various
development topics surrounding OpenBao. Its purpose and governance is outlined
in the dedicated [charter](./CHARTER.md).

## Subgroups

Currently, the following subgroups exist which tackle specific larger features
or areas within the Dev WG. Contact the reponsible leads to join. Your
contributions are much appreciated!

collaboration approach (e.g. meeting minutes or issue management) is currently
under revision.
