# Development Working Group

The Development Working Group, or Dev WG for short, focuses on various
development topics surrounding OpenBao. Its purpose and governance is outlined
in the dedicated [charter](./CHARTER.md).

## Subgroups

Currently, the following subgroups exist which tackle specific larger features
or areas within the Dev WG. Contact the reponsible leads to join. Your
contributions are much appreciated!
