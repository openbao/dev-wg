# OpenBao Dev WG / Regular Meeting

October 31th, 2024

## Attendees

 - Alex Scheel
 - Dan Ghita

## Notes

- Transit issue: [655](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/655) and [556](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/556).
  - All keys from keysutil are persistent, no flag for that.
  - [Data keys](https://openbao.org/api-docs/secret/transit/#generate-data-key) are the only non-persistent ones
 - Ephemeral keys in DH:
   - Alice has given Bob one-half DH step
   - Bob could then use an ephemeral key to finish the DH step, keep shared secret.
   - Bob then gives their public component to Alice + message with shared secret.
   - Transit encryption key (AES)
    - "Ephemeral keys" -> DH Public key, Enc(DH Private Key)
- Namespace kickoff
 - Postgres advanced storage later:
   - Either split namespaces into table or split namespaces into schemas, with each plugin being separate table, or lastly native PostgreSQL partitioning.
- Percona kickoff
 - Eventually roll into a talk at [RWC](https://rwc.iacr.org/2025/) to make it a common pattern for KMS multi-unseal as well.
- Jan and myself are both interested in [FOSDEM talks](https://fosdem.org/2025/)

## Agenda

- Namespaces are underway with SAP, genelet.
- One [security issue from upstream](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2024-21-vault-operators-in-root-namespace-may-elevate-their-privileges/70565).
- Still two outstanding features blocking v2.1.0 from my side: finish up [splitting the mount table](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/622) (tests) plus the changes for [InternalAuth](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/519).
- Open topics?
