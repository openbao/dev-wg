# OpenBao Dev WG / Regular Meeting

November 14th, 2024

## Attendees

 - Alex Scheel
 - Jan Martens
 - Dan Ghita

## Notes

- Agreed: https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/711 is sane policy. RISC-V is the most unknown Linux platform that lacks widespread CI availability, but agreed to remove for the time being. Can be reintroduced in GA if someone fixes.
- v2.1.0 GA release timeline; tentatively Nov 29th/30th/31st.
- Agreed: will try to use CODEOWNERS rather than splitting JWT into separate repo.
  - Need fallback CODEOWNERS but can get more specific, need to make sure Dave + others are in same JWT grant line.
  - AWS &co will still be separate repositories.
- Agreed: will disband openbao-maintainers group.
- Good to see PKCS#11 moving; will think about features for v2.2.0; likely early next year.

## Agenda

- Release v2.1.0 Beta failures
  - https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/711
- CODEOWNERS instead of repository forking JWT?
   - It is a non-proprietary plugin and I believe we can use "Require review from Code Owners" to get effectively the same thing.
- v2.1.0 GA release timeline; tentatively Nov 24th/25th?
- PKCS#11 support in go-kms-wrapping
- Feature planning for v2.2.0
- Open topics
