# OpenBao Dev WG / Regular Meeting

October 3rd, 2024

## Attendees

 - Alex Scheel
 - Dan Ghita

## Notes

- Fine with 2.0.2 minor release, considerations on major release schedule: maybe 2-4 a year seems great, with more frequent minor releases for CVEs & image updates & bugfixes.
  - Don't have capacity for LTS releases right now. Could be interesting in future with larger community.
  - IPv6, SSH are big fixes from my side. Will fix proxyproto when PR is merged, but won't pull in earlier. Very sufficient workaround/protection of host-level firewall restrictions from only trusted IPs on OpenBao ports.  https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/512 should be backported and probably https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/511 as well.
  - Jan likely pulling https://github.com/openbao/openbao/pull/548
- Split secret/auth engine mount tables is RFC: https://github.com/openbao/openbao/issues/432
- Splitting Postgres into separate tables will come later, likely after namespaces as namespaces are a good partitioning sentinel.
- AI @ cipherboy: split roadmap into separate issues
- [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en) and [Cels](https://github.com/google/cel-spec) are both options for an additional ACL policy mechanism.
- Can move forward with JWT RFC.
- Next meeting: technical discussion on cluster scalability?

## Agenda

- 2.0.2 release proposed by Jan
- Missing 2.1.0 release items: Transactions in Postgres, Split mount tables, and auth's internal data -- all due by me
- Roadmap organization -- separate issues?
- Fixing https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/hcsec-2024-14-vault-vulnerable-to-denial-of-service-when-setting-a-proxy-protocol-behavior/68518 requires a custom PR by former HashiCorp employe: https://github.com/pires/go-proxyproto/pull/110 -- do we want to pull this or wait for it to land upstream?
- Glob-based ~group alias~ JWT claim->policies extension
