# OpenBao Dev WG / Regular Meeting

September 19th, 2024

## Attendees

 - Alex Scheel
 - Dan Ghita
 - Nathan Phelps
 - Jan Martens

## Notes

 - Happy to have Alex push notes publicly after the meeting and can adjust as necessary.
 - Formally approved Dev WG charter.
 - AI @ cipherboy: add to October TSC agenda.
 - Agreed re: blog and using PR review for approvals. Will discuss more regarding cross-posting in the future.
 - Alex to take on Postgres transactions.
 - Not much k8s expertise on the Dev WG; would welcome new contributions in the area.

## Agenda

 - Approval of last week's meeting notes. How do we want to approve going forward?
 - Dev Charter, review & discuss voting.
 - Blog posts, if anyone wants to review my post ideas and/or wants to contribute blogs as well.
    - Gut feel: want to encourage (esp. TSC members) to cross-post, but also don't want to dominate the blog with that; perhaps 1-2/month non-technical per company?
