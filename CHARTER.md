# OpenBao Development Working Group Charter

The present document is the Development Working Group Charter (Dev WG) of the OpenBao open-source project.

This Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to the OpenBao development. This Charter complies with the [OpenBao Technical Charter](https://openbao.org/assets/OpenBao-Technical-Charter-Final-2024-05-08.pdf), the OpenBao [Community Roles document](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md#openbao-community-roles), and the [community contribution guide](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## 1. Mission and Scope of the Dev WG

The main mission of the Dev WG aims to address the following topics:

 * OpenBao development direction and software architecture;
 * Defining and presenting the OpenBao roadmap for approval by the OpenBao TSC; and
 * Fostering collaboration among OpenBao contributors to solve complex technical challenges.

As such, the following actions and procedures are in the scope of the Dev WG:

 * OpenBao technical discussions and workshops, including the possibility to invite non-members of the Dev WG;
 * Collaboration and roadmap synchronization with other open-source projects (OpenTofu, for example);
 * Architecture and implementation decisions, including but not limited to coding style, patterns, best practices, etc.;
 * Decisions about the plugins to be maintained or not. When important features/roadmap are impacted, the TSC members must be consulted;
 * Scheduling of the OpenBao releases;
 * Creating and archiving repositories for plugins, client libraries, integrations, etc.; and
 * Definition of the [contributing processes](https://github.com/openbao/openbao/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), subject to approval by the TSC.

## 2. Dev WG Internal Organization

 * The Dev WG chair is appointed by the TSC for a period of 12 months; their responsibilities include: (1) liaising with the OpenBao TSC; (2) holding and organizing meetings; (3) upholding and facilitating the voting process.

 * The initial Dev WG was [appointed by the OpenBao TSC](https://lf-edge.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/15211981/2024-06-13+OpenBao+TSC+Meeting#Maintainer-Promotions);

 * All organization-level maintainers appointed by the TSC automatically serve on this working group;

 * It can autonomously decide to promote and add new members from the community, regardless of their role in the community; and

 * A Dev WG member will forfeit, subject to simple majority vote of the Dev WG, their position after 30 days of inactivity without prior notice to another Dev WG member.

## 3. Voting

 * While the Dev WG aims to operate as a consensus-based community, if any decision requires a vote to move the Dev WG forward, the Dev WG will vote on a one vote per member basis;
 * Quorum for Dev WG meetings requires at least fifty percent of members to be present;
 * Decisions by vote at a meeting require a simple majority vote of those non-abstaining members in attendance, provided quorum is met. Decisions made by electronic vote on the mailing list, without a meeting, require a simple majority vote of non-abstaining members with a minimum calendar voting time of 7 days and a maximum of 14;
 * In the event a vote cannot be resolved by the Dev WG, the Dev WG Chair may refer the matter to the TSC for assistance in reaching a resolution; and
 * Some activities which require a vote may include: creation of new repositories; archiving of existing repositories; proposing a roadmap to the TSC; and adding new members. When in doubt of a clear consensus, it is suggested that a vote take place.

## 4. Amending This Charter

Amending this charter can be done by a 2/3rds majority electronic vote of the Dev WG, subject to approval by the OpenBao TSC.

## 5. Under the TSC

The Dev WG is governed by the OpenBao TSC which may dissolve, reform, or modify membership as it sees necessary.
